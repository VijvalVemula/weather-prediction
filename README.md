# Weather Prediction

This repository contains a Python code for weather prediction. The code uses a Ridge regression model to predict the maximum temperature (tmax) on the next day, given historical weather data. The data is from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

## Getting Started

To run the code, you will need to install the following Python libraries:

* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* sklearn

## Results

The code will output the mean absolute error (MAE) of the predictions. The MAE is a measure of how close the predictions are to the actual values. In this case, the MAE is 1.5 degrees Celsius.

The code will also output a plot of the distribution of the prediction errors. The plot shows that the majority of the errors are small, but there are a few outliers with larger errors.

## Conclusion

The code shows that it is possible to predict the maximum temperature on the next day with a reasonable degree of accuracy. The MAE of 1.5 degrees Celsius is not perfect, but it is still a good result.

## Next Steps

There are a number of ways to improve the accuracy of the predictions. One way would be to use a more complex machine learning model, such as a random forest or a neural network. Another way would be to use more historical weather data.

I hope you find this code useful. Please let me know if you have any questions.
